# QUT_Verton_SAMD_Steppers

This is the code that goes on SAMD21 on each Spin Pod Slave Board when acting as either a Slave Control Master or Slave unit.

DISCLAIMER: This software is for research and development purposes only for evaluating 
and debugging the Spin Pod Controller PCB Revision 1.0 functionality. This includes 
general operation, low-level gyro and stepper motor control, low-level emergency stop 
management, and gyro/beam spin control functions. No guarentees or responsibilities are 
given for its use beyond research evaluation at QUT on the laboratory-based prototype 
gyroscopically controlled beam.
